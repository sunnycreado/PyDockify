Command:

docker run test-image

a breakdown of the command:

"docker run": This is the command used to run a Docker container.
"pyodbc-sql": This is the name of the Docker image from which the container will be created.
When this command is executed, Docker will create a new container from the "test-image" Docker image and start it. The container will run any command specified in the image's default command, or the command specified by the user, if any.

If the image specified in the command is not available on the local machine, Docker will attempt to pull it from a Docker registry before creating the container.
